# Harbour SDK

The Harbour TypeScript SDK is a small wrapper around generated buf sources that facilitates messages signing to
authenticate with the Harbour API.

Check out our official [documentation](https://harbour-tech.github.io/) for more information on how to use the SDK, or 
take a look at the [examples](src/examples) folder.
